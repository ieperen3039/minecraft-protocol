# minecraft external data
A small lib to download and parse JSON data from the [PrismarineJS](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data) repository.
This crate is intended to only be used in build scripts.

This crate could entirely be replaced with https://github.com/Trivernis/minecraft-data-rs if it ever proves to be out-of-date.
